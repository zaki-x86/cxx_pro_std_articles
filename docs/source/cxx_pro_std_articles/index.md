## Intro

The standard library is a set of facilities that is specified by the ISO C++ standard and shipped with identical behavior by every c++ implementation. It is recommended to use the standard library whenever it is feasible.

The standard library aims to be the common foundation for other libraries. In particular, combinations of its facilities allow the standard library to play three supporting roles:

- A foundation for portability.
- A set of compact and efficient components that can be used as the foundation for perfor-
mance-sensitive libraries and applications.
- A set of components enabling intra-library communications.
